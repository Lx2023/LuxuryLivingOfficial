                    We are a B2B travel company and we only work with high-end /
                    luxury hotels & resorts. We take pride in being the only one
                    of our kind in the Indian Subcontinent.
                    <br />
                    <br /> We are completely offline & we like to keep it that
                    way.
                    <br />
                    <br /> Travel Agents approach us with their requests & we
                    assist them in selecting & booking the right luxury resort
                    for their clients.
                    <br />
                    <br /> Not many B2B companies are this bespoke &
                    consultative in their approach.

                    We always book direct with our partner hotels. No shortcuts.
                    No bypass. If a hotel is not a part of our portfolio, then
                    we don't promote it.
                    <br />
                    <br /> Snooty? Nope. being focused is more our thing!

                    Apart from servicing some of the established luxury travel
                    companies, we also support & encourage new travel companies
                    who wish to enter into the luxury travel space. We coach
                    them, train them & empower them to up-sell.
